            "text": "1. Introduction\n\n\nAcelle is a self hosted, full-featured, easy to use email marketing web application that lets you send high-volume marketing or transactional emails through your own server or a 3rd email service provider.\n\n\nInstall Acelle on your own web server and you can use marketing/transaction emails without any limitation. You can get rid of expensive email services like Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign\u2026 as you can now have full control over the entire system of your own.\n\n\nAcelle is also made for commercial purposes, allowing you to manage and sell your email services to the others (SAAS - Software As A Service).\n\n\n\n\nVersion: 3.0.0\n\n\nDeveloped by: Acelle Co., Ltd.\n\n\nFramework: PHP Laravel 5.x\n\n\n\n\n2. Installation\n\n\nAcelle is a self-hosted web application written in PHP, on top of the Laravel 5.2 framework. The followings are required to install Acelle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System: Linux (RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.). Unfortunately we have yet to support Windows or Mac OS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP Version: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1 or higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMySQL Version: >= 5.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication server: Apache, Nginx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the PHP extensions that are required for installing Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbstring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSSL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPDO Driver\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTokenizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP Zip Archive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMAP Extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry if you are not sure which extensions are available on your server, Acelle Mail will check and prompt you to install any missing one during the installation wizard\n\n\n2.1. Installation with cPanel\n\n\nIt is recommended that you install Acelle Mail onto one of your subdomains. Suppose your domain name is \nmydomain.com\n, then you may want to install Acelle Mail on a subdomain like \nmarketing.mydomain.com\n\n\nThe steps are as follows\n\n\n\n\nGo to cPanel's \nSubdomains\n menu\n\n\nAdd a subdomain named \nmarketing\n\n\nBy default, cPanel will then create a webroot folder (document root) for your subdomain at \n/marketing.mydomain.com/\n\n\nUpload Acelle Mail source files to the subdomain webroot folder. The file structure should look like this:\n\n\n\nAfter you have uploaded the source files, it is important to change the subdomain's document root to the \npublic\n folder of Acelle Mail\n\n\n\nNow you can access Acelle Mail at: \nhttp://marketing.mydomain.com\n. Follow the web installation wizard and you will get Acelle installed on your own host.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: if you are on other web hosting manager like Plesk, DirectAdmin, Kloxo... the same rules apply. The key is to set Acelle Mail's \npublic\n folder as the document root of your domain or subdomain.\n\n\n2.2. Installation with Apache 2.4\n\n\nBefore installing, make sure that Apache \nmod_rewrite\n is \nenabled\n and \nmod_security\n is \ndisabled\n.\n\n\nThen, unzip the source file\n\n\ncd /home/user/\nunzip acellemail.zip\n\n\n\n\nPut Acelle source folder into your domain or subdomain's document root. For example, if your Acelle source is located at \n/home/user/acellemail\n, you can configure Apache virtual host as follows, notice how \nDocumentRoot\n is setup\n\n\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  ServerName yourhost.net\n  DocumentRoot \"/home/user/acellemail/public\"\n  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks\n  <Directory \"/home/user/acellemail/public\">\n    AllowOverride All\n    Require all granted\n  </Directory>\n</VirtualHost>\n\n\n\n\nChange the director/file's owner to Apache's running user, to make sure it has proper permission on your source files.\nIf you are on Ubuntu, the default user that Apache runs under is \nwww-data\n (and it is \napache\n for CentOS/RedHat).\n\n\nsudo chown www-data:www-data -R /home/user/acellemail\nsudo chmod 775 -R /home/user/acellemail\n\n\n\n\nThen restart Apache and go to the webapp's installation URL. For example\n\n\nhttp://yourhost.net/install\n\n\n\n\nFollow the web installation wizard to get Acelle installed on your own host.\n\n\n3. Configuration wizard\n\n\nOnce you have successfully got Acelle Mail up and running, you can go through the configuration wizard to setup it on your server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, Acelle Mail will check if there is any library missing on the server and will remind you to install it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all the dependencies are installed, you can go to the next step to fill in the webapp information. The information can be changed later on in the Administration dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcelle Mail uses a MySQL database in the background, so you need to have one available. At this step, you need to fill in the database credentials for Acelle Mail to connect to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the database connection is established, Acelle Mail will initialize the database with the default settings as well as create the default administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcelle Mail will generate the cronjob settings so that you can install to your system. Cronjobs are used to trigger the email campaigns as well as other system processes in the background. Remember that Acelle Mail source folder must be \nwritable\n by the cronjob processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after everything is setup. You are ready to go with Acelle Mail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Getting started\n\n\n4.1. User roles\n\n\nAcelle Mail supports two different roles for user account \nadministrator\n and \ncustomer\n. One user account can be of either or both roles.\n\n\nAn \nadministrator\n is responsible for:\n\n\n\n\nManage users / groups\n\n\nManage service plans / subscriptions / payment methods\n\n\nManage sending servers\n\n\nManage bounce/feedback handlers\n\n\nManage sending domains\n\n\nManage application-wide settings\n\n\nManage shared template libraries\n\n\nMonitor application statistics\n\n\n\n\nA \ncustomer\n can actually work with mailing lists/campaigns:\n\n\n\n\nCreate/update/delete own mailing lists\n\n\nCreate/update/delete own campaigns\n\n\nMonitor own campaigns statistics\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: administrator and customer have their own view in Acelle Mail. If one user is of both roles, he can switch the view accordingly\n\n\n4.2. Create your first campaign\n\n\nIn order to send an email campaigns, the followings are required\n\n\n\n\nA sending server (an application, server or 3rd service) which actually delivers our emails\n\n\nA mail list containing the subscribers to whom we're are sending emails to\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1. Add a sending server\n\n\nThere must be at least one sending server for the system. Go to \nSending\n > \nSending Servers\n, then choose a sending server type to add. Note that both admin and customer (with appropriate permission) can add a sending server, the detailed explanation is covered in our SAAS documentation (Section 2.4). \n\n\nAs of version \n3.0.0\n, the following sending server types are supported by Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\nStandard SMTP\n: send email through an internal/external SMTP service.\n\n\nSendmail\n: send email directly through the \nsendmail\n program on the hosting server.\n\n\nPHP Mail\n: send email directly through the \nmail()\n function of PHP.\n\n\nAmazon SES API/SMTP\n: send email through Amazon Simple Mail Service, using either Amazon's web API or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\nMailgun API/SMTP\n: send email through Mailgun, using either Mailgun's web API or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\nSendGrid API/SMTP\n: send email through SendGrid, using either SendGrid's web API (v2) or standard SMTP connection.\n\n\nElasticEmail API/SMTP\n: send email through ElasticEmail, using its web API (v2)\n\n\nSparkPost API/SMTP\n: send email through ElasticEmail, using its web API\n\n\nmore to be supported...\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2. Create a mail list and campaign\n\n\nAs a customer, you can create a mail list to manage subscribers. \nGo to \nLists\n > \nCreate List\n to create a Mail List\n. Then you can add subscribers to your list (or potential subscribers can subscribe to your list through Acelle Mail supscription form). You can also import subscribers from a CSV file.\n\n\nOnce your mail list is ready, you can create an email campaign to send to your list. \nGo to \nCampaigns\n > \nCreate Campaign\n, choose the mail list to send and follow the steps to setup and send your campaign.\n\n\nThat's it! You can always track your Campaign's email delivery status (Sent/Bounced/Open) in the Campaign statistics page.\n\n\n5. Common issues & solutions\n\n\nThe open_basedir restriction in effect\n\n\nIf you are getting an error like this while opening the webapp:\n\n\nErrorException in /home/user/webapps/acellemail/app/Library/Tool.php line 637:\nis_executable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/usr/bin/php) is not within the allowed path(s): (/home/user/webapps/acellemail/email:/var/lib/php/session:/tmp)\n\n\n\n\nOr\n\n\nERROR: The directory [/storage/app] must be writable by the web server.\nERROR: The directory [/storage/framework] must be writable by the web server.\nERROR: The directory [/storage/logs] must be writable by the web server.\nERROR: The directory [/bootstrap/cache] must be writable by the web server.\n\n\n\n\nalthough you are sure the directories are already writable.\n\n\nThen it is very likely that the \nopen_basedir\n setting is currently enabled on your server, which prevents the application from loading.\nIf you are using Plesk, you can go to the domain setting page to turn it off. See the screenshot below, make sure open_basedir is set to \nnone\n.\n\n\n\n\n404 Not Found\n\n\nIf you are getting an error similar to the following while opening the webapp:\n\n\nError -\nThe requested URL /install was not found on this server.\n\n\n\n\nThen it is very likely that \nmod_rewrite\n is not yet enabled for your web application server. Please turn it on, restar the Apache/Nginx web server and refresh the page\n\n\n500 Internal Server Error\n\n\nIf you are getting 500 error, it is likely that it a file permission error. If you are on cPanel, make sure that the file/directory permission is correctly setup to \n644\n or \n755\n rather than \n775\n. Also make sure that the files/directories permission under the \npublic/\n folder of Acelle Mail is correctly setup too. Changing the parent directory permission may not recursively apply to all its children.",

In general, a common workflow is:\n\n\n\n\nAdmin setups \npayment methods\n to accept payment\n\n\nAdmin creates \nservice plans\n\n\nUser is allowed to \nsign up\n for an account, then \nsubscribe to a plan\n\n\nUser can \npay\n for the subscription\n\n\nAfter the payment is made, user can start using the services provided by Acelle Mail\n\n\n\n\n2. Administration\n\n\n2.1. Setup payment methods\n\n\nGo to admin's \nPlan > Payment Methods\n to setup the preferred payment method. As of version 3.0.0, Acelle Mail supports the followings:\n\n\n\n\nDirect payment\n\n\nPayPal (through Braintree)\n\n\nCredit cards (through Braintree)\n\n\n\n\nBraintree\n is a payment platform that allows you to accept payment by PayPal or credit cards. If you do not have a Braintree account, sign up for one at \nhttps://www.braintreepayments.com\n\n\nChoose the payment methods you prefer and enter the Braintree credentials, then enable it. Once successfully configured, users who buy the service plan will be able to pay you through the payment method.\n\n\n2.2. Create service plans\n\n\nAcelle Mail allows you to create/edit a service plan which will be available for your customers to subscribe to. Service plans represent a particular business offer. It defines the allocation of your resources, such as sending credits / mail lists / automations / subscribers / campaigns... and other features are offered to your customers.\n\n\nYou can go to admin's \nPlan > Plans\n to see the existing plans. You can create a new plan or edit an existing one.\n\n\nNote\n b\n* By default, when you setup the application, a default plan named \nDefault\n shall be created for you\n\n\n2.3. Manage subscriptions\n\n\nThis feature allows you to see the details of your customers' subscription. You can approve a payment, enable or disable a subscription.\nLet's look at a common scenario: \n\n\n\n\nUser signs up for an account by clicking on the Sign Up link in the Login page.\n\n\nThen fill in the registration form and submit it.\n\n\nA confirmation email will be sent to the registered email address.\n\n\nUser need to click on the confirmation link to activate the new account.\n\n\nAfter that, user can login to the system.\n\n\nThen user needs to subscribe to a plan, make the payment for the subscription. After that user can start using the system.\n\n\n\n\nAs an administrator, you can go to admin's \nCustomer > Subscription\n to see all these subscriptions.\n\n\n\nPossible states of a subscription includes:\n\n\n\n\ninactive\n when user first subscribes to a plan, and does not pay for it yet, the subscription is in \ninactive\n status, user cannot use the system yet.\n\n\nactive\n the subscription will become \nactive\n if the payment is successfully made (through PayPal or Credit Card). If the payment method is \nDirect\n (which actually takes place outside of the system), then the administrator needs to confirm the payment and activate the subscription manually.\n\n\ndisabled\n the subscription is manually disabled by the administrator.\n\n\n\n\nLife cycle of a subscription includes:\n\n\n\n\ncurrent\n current subscription.\n\n\npending\n the next subscription which will start in the future.\n\n\nexpired\n subscription is already expired \n\n\n\n\n2.4. Setup sending servers\n\n\nCampaign emails are actually delivered by a sending server which is an SMTP server or a 3rd service like Amazon SES or SendGrid. So, we need to setup the sending servers for the system customers. There are two types of customer in Acelle Mail:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers who are allowed to add their own sending servers (you can set this in the Sending Server tab while creating/editing a service plan). These users can then manage the sending server configuration/quota/limit on their own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers who are NOT allowed to add their own sending servers. These users do not need to know anything about sending server concept or how emails are actually delivered. They can just work with list/campaign/automation and their emails shall be sent using the sending servers added/managed by the administrator. In other words, the delivery resources must be provided by the administrator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n when it comes to actually send an email. If there are more than one sending server available, then one will be selected using fitness proportionate selection. You can configure how likely a sending server is selected by setting its \nfitness\n value when assigning sending servers to a service plan or subscription. The higher the fitness value of a sending server is, the more likely it is to be selected.",

These users can then manage the sending server configuration/quota/limit on their own.    Customers who are NOT allowed to add their own sending servers. These users do not need to know anything about sending server concept or how emails are actually delivered. They can just work with list/campaign/automation and their emails shall be sent using the sending servers added/managed by the administrator. In other words, the delivery resources must be provided by the administrator.    Note  when it comes to actually send an email. If there are more than one sending server available, then one will be selected using fitness proportionate selection. You can configure how likely a sending server is selected by setting its  fitness  value when assigning sending servers to a service plan or subscription. The higher the fitness value of a sending server is, the more likely it is to be selected.",
